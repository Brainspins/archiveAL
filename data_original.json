And so as children, we would play on those fields, like in the trees and in the grass and stuff. And there was a DIY little house that children built. And I think also some adults. And there was this sort of metal roof thingy that was sort of like waved and that had some sharp edges. And one of my friends actually walked into it with the eye. Thankfully, nothing happened. She had a kind of blue eye in the eyeball, but her eye wasn't really injured or anything, but it looked so awful, like in the cold scary. And I don't know.

So I did it quite a while ago. Okay. Yeah, okay. But that's the term that they made me that they call this function creep. That's also what it does now.
